/**
I have chosen Random Dog fact API. It returns facts about Dogs.

How it works -
https://dog-facts-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/resources/dogs/all to get all the facts at once.
Change all to parameter ?number= to specify the number of facts you want to receive.
Change all to parameter ?index= to specify the index of the fact you are targeting.

json data of the api -
It is an array of objects.
Below is the example where the array contains 2 objects. Each object has only 1 property. The propertu 
name is "fact" and the value is the actual fact about the dog. Please see example below -
https://dog-facts-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/resources/dogs?number=2 returns:
[
  {
      "fact": "Endal was the first dog to ride on the London Eye (the characteristic ferris wheel in London, England), and was also the first known dog to successfully use a ATM machine."
  },
  {
      "fact": "At the age of 4 weeks, most dogs have developed the majority of their vocalizations."
  }
]
